## Hi, My name is Emma Odia. Welcome to my corner on the internet block!

Yes, I came up with the opening quote whilst thinking about the journey one unwittingly finds himself in the ever changing landscape of Software development. I was born in the nineties in Nigeria, at a time when mobile phones and personal computers was still a distant dream. We had the landline at our house and the neighbors came to take long distance phone call at our house. I’m most certain that’s why remote communication is something that has always fascinated me ever since growing up. I got my first 2-way battery powered toy radio during my adolescent years. Though the distance it could cover was limited, we (me and the neighbor's kids my age) would play with em for hours. Simulating all possible crises situations that required our intervention to save the world and yes of course there was always a hapless damsel.

That is what started me off on the path of communication technologies. Yes, you're reading another, "How I started". I'm a software engineer with a keen interest in web communication technologies. I'm interested in tools and technologies that enhances communication as regards speed, efficiency and reliability. My language stack is Python, Ruby and JavaScript. I'm always learning new tools and techniques built using my programming stack to make my work faster and also to improve my skill level. Communication technologies is more of a mission to me than an interest. This is due to the fact that I believe that it is the one characteristic that unifies humanity. We all wish to be understood as much as we seek to understand. Technology is the intersection that brings all roads into one. I broke thought there. Yes, that happens often.

Okay, I opened this blog to share my thoughts and knowledge on technology with the world in the hopes that it becomes of advantage to anyone seeking to improve their knowledge on the subject matters I write about. My next post will be on how I set this blog up and how it is running. 

Thank you for reading this far, please if this was helpful to you, do kindly share using the social media buttons. Also you can connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/emma_odia) I’m always open to interactions on communications technology and how they can used to impact small communities. You can also see what I’m currently working on when you visit my [github](https://github.com/emmaodia). I look forward to hearing from you.
